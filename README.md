## ⚠️ Goodbye Message |  It remains in effect on 5/9/2020 ⚠️

Hello Partners,

Unfortunately I will be giving up on maintaining the library as I accept a job offer and I will start working this week and time will not allow me to do the maintenance.

I understand that this news for many who use this library would be somewhat sad, but as I said, I have no choice. For me now the most important thing and my focus would be on the job.

I very much appreciate those who supported the API, but this is not the end. For those who still want to continue using the API, I recommend that as soon as possible you fork the repo and locally maintain it, since I will stop maintaining it as soon as I start working this week.

If you have any questions about the code and how to begin to understand it, you can let me know, and I will help you. So that you can continue to maintain it without problem.

I hope you understand!
